This is the source code and binaries distribution of the Masking Distance Tool,

Compile:
$ ant compile jar

Clean:
$ ant clean

Run:
$ cd bin
$ ./maskD -h (then follow the help instructions). 

Some examples can be found
in the folder: tests/

Also, scripts for generating tests are found in tests/scripts. To generate all tests use:
./generate-tests

To replicate all experimental results shown on paper "Measuring Masking Fault-Tolerance" (Castro, D’Argenio, Demasi, Putruele), run the script: ./mask-test . For the journal extended version, the algorithms for deterministic games can be run with: ./mask-test-det

To replicate all experimental results shown on paper "Controller Synthesis in Stochastic Games with Fair Adversaries" (Castro, D’Argenio, Demasi, Putruele), run the script: ./syn-test

To replicate all experimental results shown on paper "Quantifying the Masking Fault-Tolerance of Almost-Sure Failing Systems" (Castro, D’Argenio, Demasi, Putruele), run the script: ./asf-test
